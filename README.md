# SurfsUp Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, we need to identify temperature trends before opening, especially the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. This analysis would give us some insight into how the weather would affect the business of the surf shop.

## Results

Summary statistics of June temperature is:

Key results from the above two summary statistics are:
1. The difference between the average of June and December temperatures is only about 4 degrees. Therefore, there is no large temperature difference between June and December in Oahu.
2. Both two standard deviations of the statistics are around 3.5 which show that the temperature observations are close to the average temperature.
3. December's minimum temperature is 8 degrees lower than June's minimum temperature. December's maximum temperature is 2 degrees lower than June's maximum temperature. This shows that temperatures between June and December do not have a big difference.

## Summary

Overall, the data does not show a large difference between June and December temperature. 

Two additional queries that can perform more weathere data can be:
- Query precipitation information for both June and December since rain might cause a big effect on customer flows which also might affect profits.
- Query temperature and precipitation information based on different station which can give some insight on choosing location for the shop.
